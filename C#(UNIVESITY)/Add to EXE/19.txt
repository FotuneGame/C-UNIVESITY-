I
hear
drums
echoing
tonight
But
she
hears
only
whispers
some
quiet
conversation
Shes
coming
1230
flight
moonlit
wings
reflect
stars
that
guide
me
towards
salvation
I
stopped
an
old
along
way
Hoping
find
some
old
forgotten
words
or
ancient
melodies
He
turned
me
as
if
say
Hurry
boy
its
waiting
there
you
gonna
lot
drag
me
away
from
you
Theres
nothing
that
hundred
men
or
more
could
ever
do
I
bless
rains
down
Africa
Gonna
some
do
things
never
had
ooh
ooh
wild
dogs
cry
As
they
grow
restless
longing
some
solitary
company
I
know
that
I
do
whats
right
As
sure
as
Kilimanjaro
rises
like
Olympus
above
Serengeti
I
seek
cure
whats
deep
inside
frightened
this
thing
that
Ive
become
gonna
lot
drag
me
away
from
you
Theres
nothing
that
hundred
men
or
more
could
ever
do
I
bless
rains
down
Africa
Gonna
some
do
things
never
had
ooh
ooh
Hurry
boy
shes
waiting
there
you
gonna
lot
drag
me
away
from
you
Theres
nothing
that
hundred
men
or
more
could
ever
do
I
bless
rains
down
Africa
I
bless

down
Africa
